# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

Welcome to Module 4, the capstone module exploring Vision-Language-Action models - the cutting edge of embodied AI. This module covers multimodal AI, human-robot interaction, and advanced embodied intelligence.

## Module Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Understand and implement Vision-Language-Action models
- Design embodied AI systems with reasoning capabilities
- Develop natural human-robot interaction systems
- Create multimodal perception systems
- Plan and execute complex robotic tasks

## Chapter List

This module contains 6 chapters that build upon each other to provide a comprehensive understanding of Vision-Language-Action systems:

1. [Chapter 22 - Introduction to Vision-Language-Action Models](./chapter-22-vision-language-action/index.md)
2. [Chapter 23 - Embodied AI and Reasoning](./chapter-23-embodied-ai/index.md)
3. [Chapter 24 - Human-Robot Interaction and Communication](./chapter-24-human-robot-interaction/index.md)
4. [Chapter 25 - Multimodal Perception](./chapter-25-multimodal-perception/index.md)
5. [Chapter 26 - Task Planning and Execution](./chapter-26-task-planning/index.md)
6. [Chapter 27 - Advanced Embodied Intelligence](./chapter-27-advanced-intelligence/index.md)

## Module Prerequisites

- Understanding of all concepts from Modules 1-3
- Knowledge of deep learning and neural networks
- Familiarity with multimodal AI concepts

## Estimated Completion Time

This module should take approximately 20-25 hours to complete, depending on your prior experience with multimodal AI systems.

## Progress Tracking

Track your progress through the module by marking chapters as completed. Each chapter includes hands-on labs, MCQs, and practical applications to reinforce your learning.
