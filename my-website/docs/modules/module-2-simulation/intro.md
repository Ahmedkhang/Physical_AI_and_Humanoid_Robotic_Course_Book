# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Welcome to Module 2, where you'll explore robotics simulation environments that serve as digital twins for real-world robots. This module covers Gazebo and Unity integration for creating realistic simulation environments.

## Module Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Set up and configure simulation environments
- Create robot models using URDF and SDF
- Implement physics engines and sensor simulations
- Bridge simulation to real hardware
- Design complex simulation scenarios

## Chapter List

This module contains 6 chapters that build upon each other to provide a comprehensive understanding of robotics simulation:

1. [Chapter 8 - Gazebo Simulation Environment](./chapter-8-gazebo-simulation/index.md)
2. [Chapter 9 - Robot Modeling and URDF](./chapter-9-robot-modeling/index.md)
3. [Chapter 10 - Physics Engines and Sensor Simulation](./chapter-10-physics-engines/index.md)
4. [Chapter 11 - Unity Integration for Robotics](./chapter-11-unity-robotics/index.md)
5. [Chapter 12 - Advanced Simulation Scenarios](./chapter-12-advanced-scenarios/index.md)
6. [Chapter 13 - Connecting Simulation to Reality](./chapter-13-sim-to-real/index.md)

## Module Prerequisites

- Understanding of ROS 2 concepts from Module 1
- Basic knowledge of 3D coordinate systems
- Familiarity with physical concepts (mass, friction, collisions)

## Estimated Completion Time

This module should take approximately 18-22 hours to complete, depending on your prior experience with simulation tools.

## Progress Tracking

Track your progress through the module by marking chapters as completed. Each chapter includes hands-on labs, MCQs, and practical applications to reinforce your learning.
