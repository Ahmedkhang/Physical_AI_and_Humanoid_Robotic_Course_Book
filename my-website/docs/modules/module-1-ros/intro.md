# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to Module 1, where you'll build a solid foundation in ROS 2 - the middleware that serves as the nervous system of modern robotic systems. This module covers the essential concepts needed to develop distributed robotic applications.

## Module Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Install and configure ROS 2 environments
- Develop nodes in multiple languages (Python and C++)
- Implement various communication patterns (topics, services, actions)
- Configure parameters and manage node lifecycles
- Use debugging and visualization tools effectively

## Chapter List

This module contains 7 chapters that build upon each other to provide a comprehensive understanding of ROS 2:

1. [Chapter 1 - Introduction to ROS 2 Architecture](./chapter-1-intro-ros/index.md)
2. [Chapter 2 - Nodes and Communication Primitives](./chapter-2-nodes-communication/index.md)
3. [Chapter 3 - Topics and Publishers/Subscribers](./chapter-3-topics-publishers/index.md)
4. [Chapter 4 - Services and Actions](./chapter-4-services-actions/index.md)
5. [Chapter 5 - Parameters and Launch Systems](./chapter-5-parameters-launch/index.md)
6. [Chapter 6 - ROS 2 Packages and Build System](./chapter-6-packages-build/index.md)
7. [Chapter 7 - Debugging and Visualization Tools](./chapter-7-debugging-tools/index.md)

## Module Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of programming concepts
- Familiarity with command-line interfaces
- Knowledge of basic software engineering principles

## Estimated Completion Time

This module should take approximately 20-25 hours to complete, depending on your prior experience with robotics frameworks.

## Progress Tracking

Track your progress through the module by marking chapters as completed. Each chapter includes hands-on labs, MCQs, and practical applications to reinforce your learning.
