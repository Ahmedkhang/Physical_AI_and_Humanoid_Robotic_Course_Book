# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Educational Excellence
Every chapter must have measurable learning outcomes with specific, achievable goals that students can verify. Content must be structured to ensure students can demonstrate understanding through **hands-on conceptual exercises and problem-solving**.

### II. Practical Application First
All theoretical concepts must be immediately followed by **practical examples, hands-on conceptual labs, or guided exercises**. Students learn robotics by doing — not just reading. Every chapter includes 2-3 **conceptual labs or simulations**; actual executable ROS 2 code is optional.

### III. Progressive Skill Building (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Complex concepts must be introduced incrementally with prerequisites clearly defined. Each chapter builds on previous knowledge; no forward dependencies without proper scaffolding. Students must be able to follow a linear learning path with increasing difficulty.

### IV. Real-World Relevance
All content must connect to real-world robotics applications. Sim-to-real transfer considerations should be included in every chapter where applicable. Students should understand how virtual simulations connect conceptually to physical robots like Unitree G1/Go2 with Jetson Orin Nano.

### V. Technical Accuracy and Testability
All examples must be **accurate, runnable if desired, and verifiable conceptually**. Every chapter must include 12-15 high-quality MCQs with clear correct answers. Technical concepts must be explained with analogies and visual diagrams (Mermaid).

### VI. Accessibility and Inclusion
Content must be accessible to diverse learners with multiple learning modalities (visual, textual, hands-on). All diagrams and examples should be clear to students from different backgrounds. Urdu translation support must be enabled for wider accessibility.

## Book Structure and Curriculum

This textbook follows the Panaversity Hackathon requirements with exactly 4 modules:

- **Module 1:** The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)  
- **Module 2:** The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)  
- **Module 3:** The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)  
- **Module 4:** Vision-Language-Action (VLA)  

Each chapter must include: 6-8 learning outcomes, 5-7 Gherkin specifications, Theory & Intuition section, Core Concepts with Mermaid diagrams, 2-3 conceptual hands-on labs or exercises, Sim-to-real notes (conceptual), 12-15 MCQs, and Further Reading references.

## Development Workflow

Textbook content must follow Spec-Kit Plus standards with Docusaurus compatibility. All content should be chunked with RAG settings: chunk_size=1024, overlap=200 for optimal retrieval. All diagrams must use Mermaid for consistency. Code examples can be included optionally for advanced learners.

Content must follow Panaversity theme styling for visual consistency and be written in a friendly, rigorous tone. All mathematical concepts must be properly formatted with LaTeX where needed.

Optional bonuses: personalization features, Urdu translation, background survey for student prerequisites, and Claude subagents for enhanced learning support.

## Governance

This constitution governs all content creation for "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics". All chapters must comply with these principles and requirements. Amendments require documentation, approval, and a migration plan for existing content.

All content reviews must verify compliance with learning outcomes, hands-on conceptual labs, and real-world relevance requirements. Content must follow progressive difficulty and connect conceptually to physical robotics applications.
